      The team working behind That Store has been handpicked to handle this work
      with all the love a human being can muster towards a machine. Every single
      person working behind the curtains of That Store is a gamer himself,
      including the founder of the company. When he started this project it was
      a mere hobby simply because he enjoyed building computers and it slowly
      grew up into this store and the team behind it.
